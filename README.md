### Notes
---
- The Gungnir is found naturally in the world. Can also drop from [weapon crates](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/weapon-crate).
- The loadout code is `gnr`.
- Configuration codes are `acc`, `cap`, and `proc` for Accelerator, Capacitor, and Processor, respectively. Accelerator increases charge speed, Capacitor gives an extra shot, Processor makes battery consumption more efficient.
